# Glossary

## GitOps

GitOps is a method of performing infrastructure as code (IaC) that focuses on using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

## Bootsrap

Bootstrapping is the process of starting a system using minimal resources and then using that system to obtain additional resources to continue the startup process. In the context of GitOps, bootstrapping refers to the initial setup of a GitOps environment, which typically involves setting up a Git repository to store the desired state of the system, and then using that repository to deploy and configure the necessary infrastructure and applications.

## Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production or a staging environment, where they can be further tested and validated before being released to end users. The goal of continuous delivery is to enable rapid and frequent software releases while maintaining high quality and reliability.

## Continuous Deployment

Continuous deployment is an extension of continuous delivery where changes that have passed all automated tests are automatically deployed to production. The goal of continuous deployment is to enable rapid and frequent software releases while minimizing the risk of introducing errors or downtime.

## Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. In the context of GitOps, version control is used to manage and track changes to the desired state of the system, which is stored in a Git repository.

## Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than through manual processes or point-and-click interfaces. IaC allows for infrastructure to be treated as code, which enables version control, automated testing, and continuous delivery.
